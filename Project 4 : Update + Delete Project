--Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. 
Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements 
that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.

/* What does the app's SQL look like? */
CREATE table Flo (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT,
    Phase TEXT,
    Cramp_Pain NUMERIC ); 
    
INSERT INTO Flo (name, phase , cramp_Pain)
    VALUES ("Erin", "Follicular", 5);
INSERT INTO Flo (name, phase , cramp_Pain)
    VALUES ("Suz", "Menstrual",10);
INSERT INTO Flo (name, phase , cramp_Pain)
    VALUES ("Krystelle", "Follicular", 3);
INSERT INTO Flo (name, phase , cramp_Pain)
    VALUES ("Kassy", "Ovulation", 5);
INSERT INTO Flo (name, phase , cramp_Pain)
    VALUES ("Emily", "Menstrual", 9); 
    
SELECT * FROM Flo;

UPDATE Flo 
SET name = "Patient Name"
WHERE name = "Patient Name";
SELECT  * FROM Flo;

DELETE FROM Flo 
WHERE Phase = "Follicular";
SELECT * FROM Flo;
